# Python with PostgreSQL and PostGIS

**Note:** The files in this folder can be used to run Python with PostgreSQL and PostGIS on your local computer. If you choose this option, a PostgreSQL/PostGIS installation and an import of OpenStreetMap data into a database is required.

To run the examples remotely, create a new GitHub Codespace based on: https://github.com/mario-gellrich-zhaw/python_postgresql_postgis
